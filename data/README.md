# Data Directory

This folder holds local datasets and derived artifacts.

Expected layout:
- `Classifying_Bipartite_Networks/` (dataset clone; ignored by git)
- `splits/` (generated by `scripts/run_pipeline.sh`)
- `features/` (generated by curvature extraction)

All large datasets and derived artifacts are ignored by git. Regenerate them
using the scripts in `scripts/`.
